Finished and uploaded on February 2nd, 2024. Used React Native Expo Go. This is a sports feed application for League of Legends esports. <br />
It has three tabs: standings tab, matches tab, and settings tab: <br />
Standings Tab: It displays the standings of the leagues (LCK, LPL, LEC, LCS, etc) <br />
Matches Tab: It displays the results and upcoming matches day by day for the leagues the user follows <br />
Settings Tab: You can decide which leagues to follow and whether to hide score (spoilers) or not <br />
This application uses the free version of the PandaScoreAPI. So API usage is limited <br />
Tested and runs on iPhones (IOS 16 and up) and Android phones (Android 14 and up). <br /> 
To run (after installing NodeJS 16.16.0): <br />
Open the directory in the terminal, type "npm install" then "npx expo start" <br />
and scan the QR code onto your device with the Expo Go app or use a virtual device. <br />
